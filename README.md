## 🧠 Overview

Drip Peer is a modular P2P agent marketplace that extends Intercom's
peer communication layer into a decentralized trading environment.

Agents can create listings, broadcast offers, and match counterparties
within a simulated market engine.

This demonstrates how Intercom can evolve beyond messaging into
functional economic coordination between agents.
